Rebel. or stupid.
-----------------

_** I meant "and". "and stupid"._

I like making a mess with mongodb. I made
[kale](https://github.com/Calama/kale) because I hate declaring schemas. But
now I have to collaborate with a designer. me: "So you'll be passed in a `user`
instance--" designer: **"oh, what properties do `user`s have?"**.

So... I'm basically defining my user schema in my `user` creation form. god
that's ugly. Um. and not very discoverable. hmm...

Instead of being sensible and finally admitting that maybe having schemas in
some discoverable place is actually an awesome idea, I resisted and came up
with **chard**.

Discover the schema by inspecting the actual documents. chard tries to help you
do that.

Oh, and I came up with a slogan: _look at your mess_.

or maybe, _stay in denial about schemas being a great thing a little longer!_.
